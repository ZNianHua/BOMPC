## introduction
It's a verification of the Bayesian Optimization (BO) -tuned model predictive control (MPC) algrithom. 
The algrithom is designed for a vehicle platoon system. 
## result
There are two videos of a 4-vehicle platoon, where the one is controlled by the proposed BO-tuned MPC controller, and the other is controlled by an exist controller. 
Both of the two controllers are combined lateral and longitudinal controllers for vehicle platoons.
